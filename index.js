//we talked about variables, types and conditions

var thisVarbiable = 1 //this is outdated, never use var if you can help it
let thisOtherVariable = 2 //this is the modern way to make a variable that will change. JavaScript automatically detects the type, in this case it is an integer
const stringVariable = `string ${thisVarbiable} ${thisOtherVariable}` //strings 

console.log(stringVariable)
//print out the new variable
